# Code of CS598XU Assignment 2

This repo contains:
1. `run.py`: The code for running YCSB workloads on Redis Raft cluster and inject faults
2. `parse.py`: The code for parsing YCSB output results
3. `plot.py`: The code for plotting the figures in the report

We use the fault injection implementation in https://github.com/xlab-uiuc/slooo/blob/main/faults/fault_inject.xsh to inject faults to Redis cluster.
